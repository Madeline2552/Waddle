# Waddle
Don't dawdle!

This is Madeline Neumiller's, Zoe Tiet's, and Yu Lukas Zheng's Web Programming project.

We are targeting those who are impatient, have a busy schedule, or just needs a fix fast. Our website aims to help battle against long lines at Starbucks, and other places around campus that have long lines. Our website revolves around the idea that people waiting in line can input how many people are in front of them and their projection of how long the line would take. 

Users will create a profile, they will need one to access the website and contribute to the waiting times. You will need an account to view and make changes to the estimated time interval to order. It stores the times inputted by the users to form the waiting period. Users can update data with these contributions, while also being able to change their profile information such as their password, name, username, and so on. Additionally, the option to delete a profile would also be intact. The incentive for users to add their estimated waiting time is coupons. We are implementing this, but we have no means of making it actuallly happen right now.

We will also have the option to allow employees or workers at Starbucks to contribute to the time estimation as well, so as to make up for when there was no one actually in line. We will implement a feature so that, after collecting a certain amount of data, the computer will be able to make its own estimation for when no one adds their times.
